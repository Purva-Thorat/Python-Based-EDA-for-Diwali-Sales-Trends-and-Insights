This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Diwali sales data using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to uncover customer purchasing trends and business insights.

The dataset was cleaned and transformed to remove inconsistencies, followed by detailed analysis across multiple dimensions — age group, gender, state, marital status, occupation, and product category. Visualizations were created to identify key patterns driving sales performance.

The analysis revealed that married female buyers aged 26–35 from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Karnataka contributed the highest revenue, highlighting opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns and inventory optimization during festive seasons.
